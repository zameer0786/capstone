Also, more than 140 associates are under preventive quarantine due to having been in direct or indirect contact with the virus.I am very proud to see the form, passion and dedication that everyone has worked in these days of so much uncertainty and volatility. In the last week, the IS, HR, Legal, Admin, DEG, and ISM, together with our business teams, have been implementing Secure Borderless Workspaces solutions-SBWS-as quickly as possible to enable remote work in all the countries of the region. This has been a daunting task and I would like to show my support and appreciation for what has been accomplished. Today more than 80% of our 17,500 associates in the region are working under this scheme and I hope that in the coming days it will continue to grow rapidly.I also want to express my appreciation to the hundreds of associates working on mission critical projects for which, by the nature of the service, it is not possible to establish a remote system. to minimize the risk that they may have, we have taken all sanitary measures, from the sanitation of the offices, the correct distance that must be respected between each workstation and other measures recommended by the World Health Organization and local authorities in each case.For TCS, the priority are their associates and for this we are taking all the necessary measures.

       "1  TCS won the most coveted of Tata Group awards, the JRD QV Benchmark Leader Award, at the JRD QV event on July 29, 2020. The award recognizes TCS for surpassing the impressive 750+ mark on the Excellence scale. A first in the Group and a benchmark at a global level, this achievement crowns TCS relentless effort to expand its boundaries and excel in every sphere of its business.Every year, on the occasion of JRD Tatas birth anniversary, the Tata Business Excellence group holds the JRD QV Awards event to commemorate his dreams, passion and the legacy of excellence. The prestigious event brings together MDs and CEOs of Group companies and several of their senior leaders.This year, in a first-of-its-kind virtual event, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO & MD, TCS, received the Benchmark Leader award. Chairman Emeritus, Ratan Tata and Group Chairman, N. Chandrasekaran, graced the occasion. With this award TCS leads the way for group companies as they strive to excel using the principles of the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM).TBEM is based on the renowned Malcolm Baldrige model which encourages and recognizes companies seeking to improve their business. It evaluates them on their leadership, management of strategy, customer, people, governance and operations. Since its inception, TBEM has played a key role in transforming Tata Companies.The 2019 TBEM assessment team comprised 27 senior Tata Group managers, including four TCS assessors – S Sambasivan (C&SI), Geetprasad Kagalawadi (Hitech), Lakshmi Nair (Corp DEG) and Sai Yenneti (NGM India), and was mentored by the R. Mukundan, MD & CEO of Tata Chemicals.The TCS Enterprise and four ISUs - BFSI US East, CMI EU & UK, Life Sciences EU & UK and Technology BU - were assessed. S Sukanya, VP & Global Head - Delivery Excellence & Governance, as the Executive Sponsor, played a key role in shaping the assessment, making it objective, deep diving and value adding.The intense 5-month assessment, managed by the Corporate Business Excellence Team, involved meetings with the TCS Leadership and 150+ interactions across ISUs, B&TS, geographies and functions.The assessment team shared specific feedback with the ISU – placing BFSI US East ISU as a Benchmark Leader and the other three ISUs proudly debuting as industry leaders.For the enterprise, the team shared valuable, thought provoking observations and recommendations and noted a number of TCS best practices. They appreciated TCS’ visionary leadership, strategy focus, the trust and satisfaction of our customers, the capability and passion of our associates, the rigour and strength of our delivery and operations and our industry leading business performance. They determined that these characterize an organization that is clearly a benchmark in the industry on several fronts, and awarded TCS the prized 750+ score on a 1000 point scale.TCS quest for excellence began in the late 1990s and has steadily scaled to higher levels. TCS won its first JRD QV Award in 2004 and subsequent assessments have taken the company from the Emerging Industry Leader to the Industry Leader and now to the Benchmark Leader status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2  London | Mumbai, July 27, 2020: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), (BSE: 532540, NSE: TCS) a leading global IT services, consulting and business solutions organisation, has supported the Engineering Development Trust (EDT), its long-term STEM skills partner, launch virtual educational programmes for school and college students, through its TCS iON™ Digital Learning Platform.Due to COVID-19 restrictions, experiences of work, technical skills trainings, and EDT programmes have become inaccessible for many students. To address this gap, EDT has adapted its summer programmes to become virtual by leveraging the TCS iON platform.EDT is working with 20 UK universities and 300 corporate partners to deliver the programmes. This summer will see the launch of four virtual programmes, including university taster days, experiences of work and activities, to help students interested in STEM subjects gain meaningful experiences and accreditation through Industrial Cadets. EDT and TCS have worked with universities and corporate partners to create virtual university taster courses on the TCS iON Digital Learning Platform, enabling participants to complete them at their own pace. On completion, students are awarded a Silver Industrial Cadet certification.The TCS iON platform is also extending the reach of TCS’ long established Digital Explorers programme, conducted in partnership with EDT, that aims to inspire the next generation to pursue careers in STEM. While the in-person programme typically saw around 700 participants, the first virtual event already has 9,000 registrations so far. It will include Industrial Cadets virtual work experience and experience days throughout the summer in England and into the autumn term in Scotland. Upon completion, students will receive a Challenger Industrial Cadet certification.“TCS iON is partnering with education institutions across the world to help them navigate the current challenges, and also transition into a digital era where teaching and learning do not have physical boundaries,” said Venguswamy Ramaswamy, Global Head, TCS iON. “We are delighted to once again work with EDT on programmes that inspire interest in STEM education and careers among students in UK. Virtual delivery democratises access, allowing us to reach more students than ever before.”“Experiences of work and connections with industry are critical in providing students the chance to make their own choices for their future and we are delighted to be able to offer these opportunities to young people interested in STEM subjects in a new way,” said Julie Feest, CEO, EDT. “By leveraging TCS iON platform, we are reaching students in new ways and offering them really exciting insights into the world of work. We hope that our virtual programmes will help us broaden our impact across hard to reach areas and focus on disadvantaged young people to answer the issues of widening social divide, equipping them with invaluable skills, introducing them to new people and ultimately making them more employable. I’m excited to see what the future holds for this new way of providing our programmes, and how it can benefit young people to open their eyes to what could be possible for them and their future.”The TCS iON Digital Learning Platform is used by more than 5 million learners worldwide. It enables corporates, institutes and industry mentors to collaborate on various programmes to teach and inspire the tech leaders of the future.Find out more about TCS iON: https://learning.tcsionhub.uk/iDH/uk/home.Find out more about the virtual programmes and register: https://membersarea.etrust.org.uk/content/digital-explorers-june-2020.About TCS iON.TCS iON is a strategic business unit of Tata Consultancy Services focused on enabling institutions, government departments and organizations from multiple industry sectors to be efficient in their recruitment/admissions process, learning and skilling and overall business operations with the use of ‘Phygital’ platforms.

       "4  Differentiating our Research and Innovation (R&I) capabilities is critical to positioning TCS as a Growth and Transformation (G&T) partner to our clients. Innovation Champions combine the contextual knowledge of a clients’ business with their knowledge of TCS Research and Innovation. They are critical to generating opportunities that monetise our digital capabilities and our global Co-Innovation Network (TCS COINTM). This unique role has generated considerable interest amongst clients and today there is a growing community of innovation champions in our strategic accounts.  In order to meet the growing demand, ‘TCS Innovation Champions Community of Practice’ was formally launched on July 13 and 14 as a global virtual event.  The initiative is aimed at identifying and training innovation champions who can be placed across key TCS accounts to better position TCS as a G&T partner and also build a pipeline of differentiated opportunities for our business. Senior leaders from Research and Innovation across Corporate and Units participated in the virtual event. In his keynote address, K. Ananth Krishnan, EVP & CTO, said, “Innovation Champions play a critical role in contextualizing the best of TCS R&I to the growth and transformation journeys of our clients.”.The R&I leadership outlined the value and relevance of the Innovation Champion Community of Practice. Members from the Innovation Champions community presented success stories, where they had effectively leveraged R&I to generate business value for TCS.

       "5  Dear Associates,I want to take this opportunity to update you on the situation of COVID-19 in our region. I am proud to say that our associates are doing well and that we have managed to continue operating in all countries despite the difficulties caused by this epidemic outbreak of the coronavirus.Today we can report that we have registered two positive cases of COVID-19, who are recovering without complications at home. Also, more than 140 associates are under preventive quarantine due to having been in direct or indirect contact with the virus.I am very proud to see the form, passion and dedication that everyone has worked in these days of so much uncertainty and volatility. In the last week, the IS, HR, Legal, Admin, DEG, and ISM, together with our business teams, have been implementing Secure Borderless Workspaces solutions-SBWS-as quickly as possible to enable remote work in all the countries of the region. This has been a daunting task and I would like to show my support and appreciation for what has been accomplished. Today more than 80% of our 17,500 associates in the region are working under this scheme and I hope that in the coming days it will continue to grow rapidly.I also want to express my appreciation to the hundreds of associates working on mission critical projects for which, by the nature of the service, it is not possible to establish a remote system. to minimize the risk that they may have, we have taken all sanitary measures, from the sanitation of the offices, the correct distance that must be respected between each workstation and other measures recommended by the World Health Organization and local authorities in each case.For TCS, the priority are their associates and for this we are taking all the necessary measures. I ask you to take care of yourselves and to take care of your families in these uncertain times.Let us continue to care for our clients with the same energy and passion, we are facing unusual moment and I am sure that together we will succeed.Warm Regards,Marcelo Wurmann,CEO TCS LATAM

       "6  At TCS Peru, we aim to ensure that our CSR activities can improve the environment by increasing green areas in spaces or areas with little benefit.In the San Miguel Arcangel shelter, a vulnerable group was identified that subsists on donations and state co-payments. This shelter has the capacity to provide shelter to 120 children, who rotate every 6 months and have a staff of 30 people who live with the beneficiaries.The hostel complex has more than 1,200 meters, of which TCS Peru implemented green areas in 300 sq m, more than 165 different species of trees and shrubs were cultivated.The activity was carried out by TCS associates and their families, who helped throughout the implementation process, from preparing the land to planting trees and plants. It was a long 5 hour day from early morning. Then, we talked with all the children of the shelter and we provided them with the necessary guidelines to maintain and preserve the new green areas

       "      <td>TCS won the most coveted of Tata Group awards, the JRD QV Benchmark Leader Award, at the JRD QV event on July 29, 2020. The award recognizes TCS for surpassing the impressive 750+ mark on the Excellence scale. A first in the Group and a benchmark at a global level, this achievement crowns TCS relentless effort to expand its boundaries and excel in every sphere of its business.Every year, on the occasion of JRD Tatas birth anniversary, the Tata Business Excellence group holds the JRD QV Awards event to commemorate his dreams, passion and the legacy of excellence. The prestigious event brings together MDs and CEOs of Group companies and several of their senior leaders.This year, in a first-of-its-kind virtual event, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO &amp; MD, TCS, received the Benchmark Leader award. Chairman Emeritus, Ratan Tata and Group Chairman, N. Chandrasekaran, graced the occasion. With this award TCS leads the way for group companies as they strive to excel using the principles of the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM).TBEM is based on the renowned Malcolm Baldrige model which encourages and recognizes companies seeking to improve their business. It evaluates them on their leadership, management of strategy, customer, people, governance and operations. Since its inception, TBEM has played a key role in transforming Tata Companies.The 2019 TBEM assessment team comprised 27 senior Tata Group managers, including four TCS assessors – S Sambasivan (C&amp;SI), Geetprasad Kagalawadi (Hitech), Lakshmi Nair (Corp DEG) and Sai Yenneti (NGM India), and was mentored by the R. Mukundan, MD &amp; CEO of Tata Chemicals.The TCS Enterprise and four ISUs - BFSI US East, CMI EU &amp; UK, Life Sciences EU &amp; UK and Technology BU - were assessed. S Sukanya, VP &amp; Global Head - Delivery Excellence &amp; Governance, as the Executive Sponsor, played a key role in shaping the assessment, making it objective, deep diving and value adding.The intense 5-month assessment, managed by the Corporate Business Excellence Team, involved meetings with the TCS Leadership and 150+ interactions across ISUs, B&amp;TS, geographies and functions.The assessment team shared specific feedback with the ISU – placing BFSI US East ISU as a Benchmark Leader and the other three ISUs proudly debuting as industry leaders.For the enterprise, the team shared valuable, thought provoking observations and recommendations and noted a number of TCS best practices. They appreciated TCS’ visionary leadership, strategy focus, the trust and satisfaction of our customers, the capability and passion of our associates, the rigour and strength of our delivery and operations and our industry leading business performance. They determined that these characterize an organization that is clearly a benchmark in the industry on several fronts, and awarded TCS the prized 750+ score on a 1000 point scale.TCS quest for excellence began in the late 1990s and has steadily scaled to higher levels. TCS won its first JRD QV Award in 2004 and subsequent assessments have taken the company from the Emerging Industry Leader to the Industry Leader and now to the Benchmark Leader status</td>\n",

       "      <td>London | Mumbai, July 27, 2020: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), (BSE: 532540, NSE: TCS) a leading global IT services, consulting and business solutions organisation, has supported the Engineering Development Trust (EDT), its long-term STEM skills partner, launch virtual educational programmes for school and college students, through its TCS iON™ Digital Learning Platform.Due to COVID-19 restrictions, experiences of work, technical skills trainings, and EDT programmes have become inaccessible for many students. To address this gap, EDT has adapted its summer programmes to become virtual by leveraging the TCS iON platform.EDT is working with 20 UK universities and 300 corporate partners to deliver the programmes. This summer will see the launch of four virtual programmes, including university taster days, experiences of work and activities, to help students interested in STEM subjects gain meaningful experiences and accreditation through Industrial Cadets. EDT and TCS have worked with universities and corporate partners to create virtual university taster courses on the TCS iON Digital Learning Platform, enabling participants to complete them at their own pace. On completion, students are awarded a Silver Industrial Cadet certification.The TCS iON platform is also extending the reach of TCS’ long established Digital Explorers programme, conducted in partnership with EDT, that aims to inspire the next generation to pursue careers in STEM. While the in-person programme typically saw around 700 participants, the first virtual event already has 9,000 registrations so far. It will include Industrial Cadets virtual work experience and experience days throughout the summer in England and into the autumn term in Scotland. Upon completion, students will receive a Challenger Industrial Cadet certification.“TCS iON is partnering with education institutions across the world to help them navigate the current challenges, and also transition into a digital era where teaching and learning do not have physical boundaries,” said Venguswamy Ramaswamy, Global Head, TCS iON. “We are delighted to once again work with EDT on programmes that inspire interest in STEM education and careers among students in UK. Virtual delivery democratises access, allowing us to reach more students than ever before.”“Experiences of work and connections with industry are critical in providing students the chance to make their own choices for their future and we are delighted to be able to offer these opportunities to young people interested in STEM subjects in a new way,” said Julie Feest, CEO, EDT. “By leveraging TCS iON platform, we are reaching students in new ways and offering them really exciting insights into the world of work. We hope that our virtual programmes will help us broaden our impact across hard to reach areas and focus on disadvantaged young people to answer the issues of widening social divide, equipping them with invaluable skills, introducing them to new people and ultimately making them more employable. I’m excited to see what the future holds for this new way of providing our programmes, and how it can benefit young people to open their eyes to what could be possible for them and their future.”The TCS iON Digital Learning Platform is used by more than 5 million learners worldwide.

I am proud to say that our associates are doing well and that we have managed to continue operating in all countries despite the difficulties caused by this epidemic outbreak of the coronavirus.Today we can report that we have registered two positive cases of COVID-19, who are recovering without complications at home. Also, more than 140 associates are under preventive quarantine due to having been in direct or indirect contact with the virus.I am very proud to see the form, passion and dedication that everyone has worked in these days of so much uncertainty and volatility. In the last week, the IS, HR, Legal, Admin, DEG, and ISM, together with our business teams, have been implementing Secure Borderless Workspaces solutions-SBWS-as quickly as possible to enable remote work in all the countries of the region. This has been a daunting task and I would like to show my support and appreciation for what has been accomplished. Today more than 80% of our 17,500 associates in the region are working under this scheme and I hope that in the coming days it will continue to grow rapidly.I also want to express my appreciation to the hundreds of associates working on mission critical projects for which, by the nature of the service, it is not possible to establish a remote system. to minimize the risk that they may have, we have taken all sanitary measures, from the sanitation of the offices, the correct distance that must be respected between each workstation and other measures recommended by the World Health Organization and local authorities in each case.For TCS, the priority are their associates and for this we are taking all the necessary measures. I ask you to take care of yourselves and to take care of your families in these uncertain times.Let us continue to care for our clients with the same energy and passion, we are facing unusual moment and I am sure that together we will succeed.Warm Regards,Marcelo Wurmann,CEO TCS LATAM</td>\n",

       "1  TCS won the most coveted of Tata Group awards, the JRD QV Benchmark Leader Award, at the JRD QV event on July 29, 2020. The award recognizes TCS for surpassing the impressive 750+ mark on the Excellence scale. A first in the Group and a benchmark at a global level, this achievement crowns TCS relentless effort to expand its boundaries and excel in every sphere of its business.Every year, on the occasion of JRD Tatas birth anniversary, the Tata Business Excellence group holds the JRD QV Awards event to commemorate his dreams, passion and the legacy of excellence. The prestigious event brings together MDs and CEOs of Group companies and several of their senior leaders.This year, in a first-of-its-kind virtual event, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO & MD, TCS, received the Benchmark Leader award. Chairman Emeritus, Ratan Tata and Group Chairman, N. Chandrasekaran, graced the occasion. With this award TCS leads the way for group companies as they strive to excel using the principles of the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM).TBEM is based on the renowned Malcolm Baldrige model which encourages and recognizes companies seeking to improve their business. It evaluates them on their leadership, management of strategy, customer, people, governance and operations. Since its inception, TBEM has played a key role in transforming Tata Companies.The 2019 TBEM assessment team comprised 27 senior Tata Group managers, including four TCS assessors – S Sambasivan (C&SI), Geetprasad Kagalawadi (Hitech), Lakshmi Nair (Corp DEG) and Sai Yenneti (NGM India), and was mentored by the R. Mukundan, MD & CEO of Tata Chemicals.The TCS Enterprise and four ISUs - BFSI US East, CMI EU & UK, Life Sciences EU & UK and Technology BU - were assessed. S Sukanya, VP & Global Head - Delivery Excellence & Governance, as the Executive Sponsor, played a key role in shaping the assessment, making it objective, deep diving and value adding.The intense 5-month assessment, managed by the Corporate Business Excellence Team, involved meetings with the TCS Leadership and 150+ interactions across ISUs, B&TS, geographies and functions.The assessment team shared specific feedback with the ISU – placing BFSI US East ISU as a Benchmark Leader and the other three ISUs proudly debuting as industry leaders.For the enterprise, the team shared valuable, thought provoking observations and recommendations and noted a number of TCS best practices. They appreciated TCS’ visionary leadership, strategy focus, the trust and satisfaction of our customers, the capability and passion of our associates, the rigour and strength of our delivery and operations and our industry leading business performance. They determined that these characterize an organization that is clearly a benchmark in the industry on several fronts, and awarded TCS the prized 750+ score on a 1000 point scale.TCS quest for excellence began in the late 1990s and has steadily scaled to higher levels. TCS won its first JRD QV Award in 2004 and subsequent assessments have taken the company from the Emerging Industry Leader to the Industry Leader and now to the Benchmark Leader status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2  London | Mumbai, July 27, 2020: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), (BSE: 532540, NSE: TCS) a leading global IT services, consulting and business solutions organisation, has supported the Engineering Development Trust (EDT), its long-term STEM skills partner, launch virtual educational programmes for school and college students, through its TCS iON™ Digital Learning Platform.Due to COVID-19 restrictions, experiences of work, technical skills trainings, and EDT programmes have become inaccessible for many students. To address this gap, EDT has adapted its summer programmes to become virtual by leveraging the TCS iON platform.EDT is working with 20 UK universities and 300 corporate partners to deliver the programmes. This summer will see the launch of four virtual programmes, including university taster days, experiences of work and activities, to help students interested in STEM subjects gain meaningful experiences and accreditation through Industrial Cadets. EDT and TCS have worked with universities and corporate partners to create virtual university taster courses on the TCS iON Digital Learning Platform, enabling participants to complete them at their own pace. On completion, students are awarded a Silver Industrial Cadet certification.The TCS iON platform is also extending the reach of TCS’ long established Digital Explorers programme, conducted in partnership with EDT, that aims to inspire the next generation to pursue careers in STEM. While the in-person programme typically saw around 700 participants, the first virtual event already has 9,000 registrations so far. It will include Industrial Cadets virtual work experience and experience days throughout the summer in England and into the autumn term in Scotland. Upon completion, students will receive a Challenger Industrial Cadet certification.“TCS iON is partnering with education institutions across the world to help them navigate the current challenges, and also transition into a digital era where teaching and learning do not have physical boundaries,” said Venguswamy Ramaswamy, Global Head, TCS iON. “We are delighted to once again work with EDT on programmes that inspire interest in STEM education and careers among students in UK. Virtual delivery democratises access, allowing us to reach more students than ever before.”“Experiences of work and connections with industry are critical in providing students the chance to make their own choices for their future and we are delighted to be able to offer these opportunities to young people interested in STEM subjects in a new way,” said Julie Feest, CEO, EDT. “By leveraging TCS iON platform, we are reaching students in new ways and offering them really exciting insights into the world of work. We hope that our virtual programmes will help us broaden our impact across hard to reach areas and focus on disadvantaged young people to answer the issues of widening social divide, equipping them with invaluable skills, introducing them to new people and ultimately making them more employable. I’m excited to see what the future holds for this new way of providing our programmes, and how it can benefit young people to open their eyes to what could be possible for them and their future.”The TCS iON Digital Learning Platform is used by more than 5 million learners worldwide. It enables corporates, institutes and industry mentors to collaborate on various programmes to teach and inspire the tech leaders of the future.Find out more about TCS iON: https://learning.tcsionhub.uk/iDH/uk/home.Find out more about the virtual programmes and register: https://membersarea.etrust.org.uk/content/digital-explorers-june-2020.About TCS iON.TCS iON is a strategic business unit of Tata Consultancy Services focused on enabling institutions, government departments and organizations from multiple industry sectors to be efficient in their recruitment/admissions process, learning and skilling and overall business operations with the use of ‘Phygital’ platforms.

       "4  Differentiating our Research and Innovation (R&I) capabilities is critical to positioning TCS as a Growth and Transformation (G&T) partner to our clients. Innovation Champions combine the contextual knowledge of a clients’ business with their knowledge of TCS Research and Innovation. They are critical to generating opportunities that monetise our digital capabilities and our global Co-Innovation Network (TCS COINTM). This unique role has generated considerable interest amongst clients and today there is a growing community of innovation champions in our strategic accounts.  In order to meet the growing demand, ‘TCS Innovation Champions Community of Practice’ was formally launched on July 13 and 14 as a global virtual event.  The initiative is aimed at identifying and training innovation champions who can be placed across key TCS accounts to better position TCS as a G&T partner and also build a pipeline of differentiated opportunities for our business. Senior leaders from Research and Innovation across Corporate and Units participated in the virtual event. In his keynote address, K. Ananth Krishnan, EVP & CTO, said, “Innovation Champions play a critical role in contextualizing the best of TCS R&I to the growth and transformation journeys of our clients.”.The R&I leadership outlined the value and relevance of the Innovation Champion Community of Practice. Members from the Innovation Champions community presented success stories, where they had effectively leveraged R&I to generate business value for TCS.

       "5  Dear Associates,I want to take this opportunity to update you on the situation of COVID-19 in our region. I am proud to say that our associates are doing well and that we have managed to continue operating in all countries despite the difficulties caused by this epidemic outbreak of the coronavirus.Today we can report that we have registered two positive cases of COVID-19, who are recovering without complications at home. Also, more than 140 associates are under preventive quarantine due to having been in direct or indirect contact with the virus.I am very proud to see the form, passion and dedication that everyone has worked in these days of so much uncertainty and volatility. In the last week, the IS, HR, Legal, Admin, DEG, and ISM, together with our business teams, have been implementing Secure Borderless Workspaces solutions-SBWS-as quickly as possible to enable remote work in all the countries of the region. This has been a daunting task and I would like to show my support and appreciation for what has been accomplished. Today more than 80% of our 17,500 associates in the region are working under this scheme and I hope that in the coming days it will continue to grow rapidly.I also want to express my appreciation to the hundreds of associates working on mission critical projects for which, by the nature of the service, it is not possible to establish a remote system. to minimize the risk that they may have, we have taken all sanitary measures, from the sanitation of the offices, the correct distance that must be respected between each workstation and other measures recommended by the World Health Organization and local authorities in each case.For TCS, the priority are their associates and for this we are taking all the necessary measures. I ask you to take care of yourselves and to take care of your families in these uncertain times.Let us continue to care for our clients with the same energy and passion, we are facing unusual moment and I am sure that together we will succeed.Warm Regards,Marcelo Wurmann,CEO TCS LATAM

       "6  At TCS Peru, we aim to ensure that our CSR activities can improve the environment by increasing green areas in spaces or areas with little benefit.In the San Miguel Arcangel shelter, a vulnerable group was identified that subsists on donations and state co-payments. This shelter has the capacity to provide shelter to 120 children, who rotate every 6 months and have a staff of 30 people who live with the beneficiaries.The hostel complex has more than 1,200 meters, of which TCS Peru implemented green areas in 300 sq m, more than 165 different species of trees and shrubs were cultivated.The activity was carried out by TCS associates and their families, who helped throughout the implementation process, from preparing the land to planting trees and plants. It was a long 5 hour day from early morning. Then, we talked with all the children of the shelter and we provided them with the necessary guidelines to maintain and preserve the new green areas
